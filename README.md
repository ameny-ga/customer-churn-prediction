# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a retail/business context. The goal is to identify customers likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy: Data preprocessing & analysis
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning models & evaluation

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - Loaded customer dataset
   - Handled missing values & encoded categorical variables
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created features: purchase frequency, recency, spending patterns
   - Scaled numerical features
3. **Model Building**
   - Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM
   - Selected Random Forest as best model
4. **Model Optimization**
   - Hyperparameter tuning & cross-validation
   - Achieved ~87% accuracy

## 📈 Results & Insights
- High accuracy in predicting churn
- Key risk factors: low purchase frequency, declining engagement
- Business impact: Enables targeted retention strategies, reducing revenue loss
